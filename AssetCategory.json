Users can interact with different smart contracts on these platforms to perform various actions such as lending and borrowing funds, staking their assets or minting NFTs.\r\n\r\nSmart contracts are programs that are stored on the blockchain and are automatically executed when certain conditions are met. To interact with these smart contracts, transaction fees may need to be paid and the amount and asset required will vary based on the platform\u2019s architecture. Usually, the smart contract platform\u2019s native token is used to pay for transaction fees. Some popular examples of smart contract platforms include Ethereum, Solana and Polygon.",
